                Went on a walk <br>
                Read in bed and fell back asleep <br>
                Drank coffee, ate granola, and read in my <a href="picturepages/redchair.html" onclick="positionedPopup(this.href,'redchair','306','407','105','207','yes');return false">red comfy chair.</a><br>
                Stopped reading <i>All My Rage</i> because I <a href='popup3/nojoy.html' onclick="positionedPopup(this.href,'nojoy','150','500','100','200','yes');return false">wasn't enjoying</a> it very much. I started reading <i>Hard boiled wonderland / The end of the world. </i> <br> 
                Walked to campus with Quinn. We sat on the lawn and talked and read until the sun hid behind the clouds. <br>
                Cooked dinner <br>
                Played super smash bros with a <a href='popup3/bunch.html' onclick="positionedPopup(this.href,'bunch','100','250','0','1300','yes');return false"> bunch</a> of people.  <br>
                Today was a good day.
