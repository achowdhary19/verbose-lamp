                My friend from highshool messaged me when she saw that I was in ******. She had an overnight layover on her way to Tokyo and she wanted to hang out as part of her plan to stay up all night, sleep on the plane, and completely avoid the jet lag. I dont have a car, so it worked out perfectly that we could both easily bus to this bar. I was hestitant to go at first because I've been in a funk, but it felt really good to talk to her. We got some snacks and cigarettes from the gas station, sat in the grass for a bit, and then parted ways.
